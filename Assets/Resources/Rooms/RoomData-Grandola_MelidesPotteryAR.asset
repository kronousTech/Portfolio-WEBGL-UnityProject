    info: "The project was developed with the purpose of creating entertaining animations
      related to the pottery process and Gr\xE2ndola's old cultures."

    info: This project was straightforward overall, with the primary hurdle being
      effectively interpreting AR markers and ensuring consistent tracking once the
      models appeared.
  - category: 4
    info: To ensure reliable tracking, we implemented a 3-second timer. This way,
      if the marker temporarily lost tracking, the object would persist in its last
      known position. This helped prevent the object from disappearing due to minor
      tracking glitches when the marker detection faltered.
