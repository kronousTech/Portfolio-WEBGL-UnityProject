    info: The primary objective of this project was to showcase diverse environments
      illuminated by various types of lighting. This was accomplished through a dynamic
      exploration of distinct 360-degree images, seamlessly adjusting their presentation
      in response to the selected lighting conditions.

    info: In embarking on my first WebGL project, I encountered a range of new challenges
      related to optimization and build sizes. These challenges provided valuable
      learning opportunities, allowing me to deepen my understanding of WebGL development
      intricacies and refine my problem-solving skills.
  - category: 4
    info: To address the optimization and build size concerns, I began by reducing
      the quality of various images. In some cases, the default quality was unnecessarily
      high, and cutting it in half significantly reduced the build size. This adjustment
      resulted in smoother application performance with almost no noticeable difference
      in visual quality.
