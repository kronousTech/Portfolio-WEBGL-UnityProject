    info: This project showcases the traditional process of crafting clay pots, allowing
      players to experience each step, from gathering raw clay to shaping and eventually
      selling the finished pot.

    info: Being a long experience, the main challenge involved establishing a system
      to incorporate multiple tasks for players. Each task required a clear condition
      and corresponding visual cues to guide the player. Additionally, there was
      a need for visual or auditory feedback upon task completion.

    info: To address this challenge, I devised a script encompassing all scene tasks,
      iterating to the next one once the current task was finished. I established
      an abstract class for tasks, providing a flexible structure that allowed for
      creativity and expansion while maintaining a robust foundation.
