    info: "Job name : Unity Developer - C# integration with an external API\n\nIn
      my initial Upwork assignment, I collaborated with Alan Mac Cormack, the founder
      of Codeverze. My main responsibility was integrating API's into Unity applications,
      working closely alongside Alan and his team.\n\nThroughout this collaboration,
      both Alan and his team demonstrated excellence in their work, and commitment
      to teaching and providing assistance whenever needed.\nThis experience has
      set a high standard for my expectations in future Upwork endeavors.\n\nUnfortunately,
      I'm unable to provide specific project details due to the signing of a non-disclosure
      agreement (NDA). \n\nFor further insights into Codeverze you can explore their
