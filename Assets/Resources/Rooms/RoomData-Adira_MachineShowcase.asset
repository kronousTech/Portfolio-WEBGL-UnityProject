      in intricate detail. The experience unfolds through dynamic animations, allowing
      users to witness the machines in action. Moreover, the immersive environment
      empowers users to actively engage with the machinery, allowing them to learn
      about the production process.

    info: At first, we planned to use the SteamVR SDK for VR controls and interaction.
      However, as the project progressed, we switched to the Oculus Plugin because
      we decided to develop for the Oculus Quest 2 instead.

    info: Due to the complexity of the machine models, performance issues quickly
      became present in the project.
  - category: 4
    info: To improve performance, several LOD's were created for the models present
      in the scene. With the addition of LOD's and a downgrade in the quality settings,
      we managed to maintain a consistent frame rate throughout the experience.
