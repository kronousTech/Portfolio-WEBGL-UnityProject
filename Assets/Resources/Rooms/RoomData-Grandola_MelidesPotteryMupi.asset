    info: This project was designed for an interactive Mupi, featuring small, engaging,
      and educational games centered around Melides pottery. The primary aim was
      to offer a compact yet enjoyable experience, providing users with both entertainment
      and insights into the world of Melides pottery.

    info: The trickiest aspect of this project was putting together the Word Search
      game, especially since it was my first attempt at creating one.

    info: "To develop the Word Search game, I devised a system for placing words
      on a grid, allowing certain letter squares to serve multiple words. \nFirst,
      I randomly determined the direction of the word\u2014horizontal or vertical.
      Once the direction was set, I selected a starting position by calculating a
      range within the grid size, considering the word's letter count. Moving through
      the squares, I checked if each square was either empty or contained the same
      letter as the one being placed.\r\n\r\nIf placing the word wasn't feasible,
      I sought a new position. In cases of repeated unsuccessful attempts, I reset
      the temporary grid board and restarted the generation process. To minimize
      the need for restarts, I ensured the grid was slightly larger than the largest
      word, this made the need for restarts very rare. After placing all the words,
      I filled the remaining empty squares with random letters and then displayed
      the grid on the screen."
