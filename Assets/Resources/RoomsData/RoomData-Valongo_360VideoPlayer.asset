    info: 'This project was developed for the Valongo Municipal Chamber to showcase
      the city''s rich tourist appeal. Its primary objective was to vividly portray
      the diverse attractions and cultural gems that contribute to the city''s unique
      allure.


      The narrative unfolded through a captivating series of immersive
      360-degree videos.'

    info: "The challenge in this project was to showcase a 360\xBA video within a
      sphere, creating a fully immersive viewing experience."
  - category: 4
    info: To address this, we implemented a solution by incorporating a render texture
      into the sphere material. This render texture was also applied to the video
      player. While in retrospect, this solution seems straightforward, at the time,
      with less experience in Unity, it took some time to figure out.
