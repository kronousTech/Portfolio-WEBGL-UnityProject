    info: Goldenergy is a Portuguese company in the free energy market. It offers
      electricity and gas tariffs for both individual customers and businesses, allowing
      them to choose either one or both of the energy services.
  - category: 2
    info: This compact project was created for a sustainable energy company within
      a tight three-day deadline. The objective was to craft an adventure for Goldy
      the gorilla. The result was an endless runner, drawing inspiration from games
      like Subway Surfers. Players control Goldy as they navigate side-to-side, jump,
      and roll to avoid obstacles, represented by a rolling tree trunk. The game
      features basic mechanics and employs randomly generated obstacles for a dynamic
      experience.

    info: "\rThe main difficulties revolved around a tight deadline and the need
      to develop a procedurally generated system that could present obstacles for
      the player to dodge."

    info: "\rIn my first year of professional work, facing a tight deadline for the
      first time prompted me to meticulously organize the tasks I had so I would
      be able to complete the development of the game. \n\nThe incorporation of random
      obstacles posed both an entertaining and challenging aspect of the project.
      Since the character would be running around a spherical scenario, precise placement
      of obstacles with suitable distance and rotation was crucial to seamlessly
      integrate them into the scene without clipping with each other. Moreover, the
      obstacles would also need to disappear after the player dodges them to have
      room for new ones to spawn. This leads me to know more about object pooling
      and the benefits it was on optimization."
