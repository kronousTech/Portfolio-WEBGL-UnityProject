    info: Developed for both Android and iOS, this project leverages the ArCore and
      ArKit frameworks to provide users with an engaging augmented reality (AR) experience.
      The app allows users to place products in their actual size for an immersive
      view or scale them down for a more comprehensive perspective. Additionally,
      users have the creative freedom to construct personalized houses using a custom
      editor. The primary goal of the app is to showcase the diverse collection of
      products offered by the client, combining functionality with a seamless AR
      interface.

    info: "\rThe main challenge for this app was devising a method to make it compatible
      with both iOS and Android by incorporating both the ARKit and ARCore plugins."
  - category: 4
    info: To enable this app to utilize both ARKit and ARCore plugins, I invested
      considerable time in thoroughly studying the documentation for both ARKit and
      ARCore. By identifying essential elements for app functionality, I integrated
      these scripts into the scene and adjusted them to coexist harmoniously. Additionally,
      I implemented a script to detect whether the app was developed for iOS or Android,
      enabling or disabling the necessary scripts accordingly.
